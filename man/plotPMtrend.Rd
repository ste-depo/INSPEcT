\title{Plot the premature/mature trend from an object of class INSPEcT_diffsteady}
\usage{
plotPMtrend(inspectIds)

\arguments{
\item{inspectIds}{An object of class INSPEcT_steadyNoNascent}

\description{
Plot the null model estimated for the specific dataset. The null model
is the trend between premature and mature expression, which is usually
linear in the log-log scale and generally points to an increase in the
ratio between premature and mature RNA at increased levels of 
expression
